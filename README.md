**A practical guide to revealing anti-patterns and architectural pitfalls to avoid microservices fallacies**

## What is this book about?
Microservices have been widely adopted for designing distributed enterprise apps that are flexible, robust, and fine-grained into services that are independent of each other. There has been a paradigm shift where organizations are now either building new apps on microservices or transforming existing monolithic apps into microservices-based architecture. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
- Discover the responsibilities of different individuals involved in a microservices initiative.
- Avoid the common mistakes in architecting microservices for scalability and resiliency.
- Understand the importance of domain-driven design when developing microservices.
- Identify the common pitfalls involved in migrating monolithic applications to microservices.
- Explore communication strategies, along with their potential drawbacks and alternatives.
- Discover the importance of adopting governance, security, and monitoring.
- Understand the role of CI/CD and testing
